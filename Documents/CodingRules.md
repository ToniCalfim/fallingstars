# Coding Rules
+ Make good code. Improve as you code. Don't depend on improving later. So you don't need to code again.
+ It's paramount that your code can be understood by everybody.
+ Keep the code absolutely simple. Revisit your functions and figure out how to simplify them even more.
+ You're your best beta tester, and should never allow bugs or crashes. Test and discuss the code before push.
+ Fix a bug as soon as your see it; if you continue, your code will all be buggy and unstable.
+ Write your code for this project, not to be used later. You'll write new code later, because you'll be smarter, and probably using new tools.
+ A function has to do only the one task it is meant to do.
+ Try to code transparently, using good Clean Code technics, and comments.
+ Coding is art. Every program is a different artist. It's the result that matters.
